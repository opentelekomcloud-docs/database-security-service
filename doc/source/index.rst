Data Ingestion Service
======================

Data Ingestion Service (DIS) addresses the challenge of transmitting data from outside the cloud to inside the cloud. DIS builds data intake streams for custom applications capable of processing or analyzing streaming data. DIS continuously captures, transmits, and stores terabytes of data from hundreds of thousands of sources every hour, such as logs, Internet of Things (IoT) data, social media feeds, website clickstreams, and location-tracking events.

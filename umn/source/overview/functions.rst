Functions
=========

Database audit delivers functions such as user behavior detection and audit, multi-dimensional lead analysis, real-time alarms, and reports.

-  User Behavior Detection and Audit

   -  Associates access operations in the application layer with those in the database layer.
   -  Uses built-in or user-defined privacy data protection rules to mask private data (such as accounts and passwords) in audit logs displayed on the console.

-  Multi-dimensional Lead Analysis

   -  Behavior analysis

      Supports analysis in multiple dimensions, such as audit duration, statement quantity, risk quantity, risk distribution, session statistics, and SQL distribution.

   -  Session analysis

      Conducts analysis based on time, user, IP address, and client.

   -  Statement analysis

      Provides multiple search criteria, such as time, risk severity, user, client IP address, database IP address, operation type, and rule.

-  Real-time Alarms for Risky Operations and SQL Injection

   -  Risky operation

      Defines a risky operation in fine-grained dimensions such as operation type, operation object, and risk severity.

   -  SQL injection

      Provides an SQL injection library, which facilitates alarm reporting for database exceptions based on the SQL command feature or risk severity.

   -  System resource

      Reports alarms when the usage of system resources (CPU, memory, and disk) reaches configured threshold.

-  Fine-grained Reports for Various Abnormal Behaviors

   -  Session behavior

      Provides session analysis report of the client and database users.

   -  Risky operation

      Provides the risk distribution and analysis report.

Checking Database Agent Status
------------------------------

#. Log in to the node where the agent is installed as user **root** by using a cross-platform remote access tool (for example, PuTTY) via SSH.

#. Run the following command to view the running status of the agent program:

   **ps** **-ef|grep** **audit_agent**

   -  If the following information is displayed, the agent is running properly. Go to :ref:`4 <dbss_01_0235__li321115454910>`.

      ::

         /opt/dbss_audit_agent/bin/audit_agent

   -  If no information is displayed, the agent does not run properly. Go to :ref:`3 <dbss_01_0235__li10382244413>`.

#. .. _dbss_01_0235__li10382244413:

   Run the following command to restart the agent:

   **service** **audit_agent** **restart**

   -  If the fault is rectified, no further operation is required.
   -  If the problem persists, go to :ref:`4 <dbss_01_0235__li321115454910>`.

#. .. _dbss_01_0235__li321115454910:

   Run the following command to check the communication status between the agent and database audit instance:

   **tailf** **/opt/dbss_audit_agent/log/audit_agent.log**

   -  If information similar to the following is displayed, the communication between the agent and database audit instance is normal. Go to :ref:`Verifying the Result <dbss_01_0235__section02572203259>`.

   -  If information similar to the following is displayed, the communication between the agent and database audit instance is abnormal. Go to :ref:`Checking the Security Group Rules of the Database Audit Instance <dbss_01_0235__section20936182118324>`.

#. Select an instance where the database is located from the **Instance** drop-down list.

#. Record the IP address of the agent node.

   Click |image1| next to the database to view the information of its agent, and record **Installing Node IP Address**.

#. Add an inbound rule for the installing node.

   a. Click **OK**.

Verifying the Result
--------------------

In your database, run an SQL statement on the node where the agent is installed, and then search for the statement in the SQL statement list.

-  If the SQL statement is found, the problem has been solved.
-  If the SQL statement is not found, the problem persists. Contact customer service.

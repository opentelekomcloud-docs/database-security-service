How Soon Can I Receive an Alarm Notification If an Exception Occurs in Database Audit?
======================================================================================

When database audit is running properly, if an exception occurs, you will receive an alarm notification within 5 minutes.

If you set alarm notifications, when database audit is running properly, the system generates an alarm notification when a metric of a database audit instance resource (CPU, memory, or disk) exceeds the alarm threshold. You can receive the notification within about 5 minutes.
